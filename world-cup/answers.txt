Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: france falling out of the top three

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000 i believe after this point the result in the top three teams get consistent
