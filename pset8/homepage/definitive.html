            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                In August 2021, a report published by Kotaku detailed that Rockstar Games was developing a remastered trilogy of Grand Theft Auto titles: Grand Theft Auto III, Vice City, and San Andreas, originally developed by Rockstar North. According to the report, its development was led by Rockstar Dundee and uses the Unreal Engine. In September, the Game Rating and Administration Committee in South Korea gave the trilogy a game rating. Media speculation about the game continued in early October after an update to the Rockstar Games Launcher included related data to the game in addition to logos, art, and game achievements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several days later, on October 8, 2021, Rockstar officially announced the remastered trilogy on its website and social media pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Existing versions of the three games were removed from digital retailers on October 11, 2021. Audiences and journalists criticized the move, citing concerns with video game preservation, a lack of choice between versions, and the potential removal of music due to expired licenses, which had occurred with previous re-releases.
